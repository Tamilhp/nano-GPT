## Overview

This repository hosts a GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model built entirely from scratch. The project aims to demonstrate the capabilities of a decoder-only transformer architecture in text generation tasks. It serves as a proof of concept and has been benchmarked against competitive performance metrics.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **Decoder-Only Transformer Architecture**: The core of the project is a GPT model built from scratch, utilizing a decoder-only transformer architecture. This design choice enables the model to excel in text generation tasks.
  
- **High-Performance Metrics**: Rigorous testing and benchmarking have been conducted to ensure the model's reliability and efficiency. The model has met and exceeded industry standards.

- **Text Generation Capabilities**: The model is capable of various text-based applications, from chatbots and virtual assistants to content generation and summarization.
